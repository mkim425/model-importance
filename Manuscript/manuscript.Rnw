\begin{abstract}
Ensemble forecasting is generally recognized for its ability to outperform individual standalone models in infectious disease forecasting and is therefore considered a robust option for public health decision making and policy planning. The US COVID-19 Forecast Hub has produced a probabilistic ensemble forecast model of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States based on forecasts from individual models developed by more than 90 different research groups. As the Forecast Hub served as the official short-term forecast of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is important to understand the relative importance and contributions of individual models to creating a highly accurate forecast combination. 
In this work, we propose two practical methods for evaluating the contribution of individual component models. 
One method uses a leave-one-model-out algorithm when building an ensemble and the other, based on the Shapley value in game theory, considers ensemble models constructed from all possible subsets of individual models. 
We aim to identify and evaluate methods for measuring the contributions of individual component models to ensemble accuracy. We explore how these metrics are related to the weighted interval score (WIS), a commonly used proper scoring rule for quantile forecasts, and illustrate how these methods provide distinct perspectives when evaluating how much value a component model adds to a probabilistic ensemble model in the presence of other models. Our results show that the most accurate model according to WIS does not always add the most value to the ensemble. This indicates that our proposed methods can be used to capture the contribution of individual models to a more accurate ensemble model, which is difficult to ascertain from standard accuracy metrics alone. This study offers valuable insights into understanding individual forecasting modelsâ€™ unique features and their roles in contributing to an ensemble model for a specific prediction task.
